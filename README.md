# PracticalMachineLearningProject
Course Project for Practical Machine Learning on Coursera

## Background (verbatim from Coursera)

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity 
relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements 
about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The data for this project come from this source: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

## Project Goal

The goal of the project is to use machine learning to build a prediction model for the categorical variable *classe*, which has five levels
indicating how well a participant completed an exercise.
